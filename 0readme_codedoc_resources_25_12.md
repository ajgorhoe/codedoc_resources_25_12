# Code Documentation Resources, from December 2025

This repository ([codedoc_resources_25_12](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/codedoc_resources_25_12)) replaces the first codedoc_recources repository and provides newer Doxygen and GraphViz binaries used in generation of code documentation via tools in the `codedoc` repository.

**Warning**: 

* The file `bin/doxygen/libclang.dll` is included in the repository via LFS (large file storage). 
* For these files, **monthly bandwidth is limited** to 10 GB per account. 
* In order not to exceed the bandwidth and to keep the repository functional, try to **clone the repository once** and then use the local clone.
* Also, **fork the repository** to your account in order to reduce the number of users that use the same bandwidh quota.
